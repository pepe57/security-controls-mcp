## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Bundled public framework profiles** — BIO (Netherlands), KATAKRI (Finland), NSM (Norway), MSB (Sweden), CFCS (Denmark), CCB/CyFun (Belgium), and ANSSI cyber hygiene guidance (France)
- **Public standards registry support** — bundled public profiles now load automatically alongside SCF and user-imported paid standards
- **Public profile tests** — coverage for bundled profile listing, querying, and clause retrieval

### Changed
- `list_available_standards`, `query_standard`, and `get_clause` now distinguish built-in SCF mappings, bundled public profiles, and imported paid standards
- `about` now reports bundled public profile counts and provenance metadata
- README and architecture docs now document bundled public-source profile coverage
- Reverse-index-only frameworks now aggregate multiple source section IDs onto a single SCF control entry, fixing inflated counts for TIBER-EU
- Current metadata and tests now reflect the 262-framework SCF dataset actually shipped by the server

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **100% framework categorization** — all 261 frameworks now in 26 categories for discoverability
